  <!-- EXAMPLE LYRICS -->
  If you don't wanna see me<br>
  <br>Did a full 180, crazy
  <br>Thinking 'bout the way I was
  <br>Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
  <br>But look at where I ended up
  <br>I'm all good already
  <br>So moved on, it's scary
  <br>I'm not where you left me at all, so<br>
  <br>If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
  <br>If you wanna believe that anything could stop me<br>
  <br>Don't show up, don't come out
  <br>Don't start caring about me now
  <br>Walk away, you know how
  <br>Don't start caring about me now<br>
  <br>Aren't you the guy who tried to
  <br>Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
  <br>Though it took some time to survive you
  <br>I'm better on the other side
  <br>I'm all good already
  <br>So moved on, it's scary
  <br>I'm not where you left me at all, so<br>
  <br>If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
  <br>If you wanna believe that anything could stop me<br>
  <br>Don't show up, don't come out
  <br>Don't start caring about me now
  <br>Walk away, you know how
  <br>Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now, 'bout me)<br>
  <br>Oh, oh
  <br>Don't come out, out, out
  <br>Don't show up, up, up
  <br>Don't start now (oh)<br>
  <br>Oh, oh
  <br>Don't come out, out
  <br>I'm not where you left me at all, so<br>
  <br>If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
  <br>If you wanna believe that anything could stop me<br>
  <br>Don't show up (don't show up), don't come out (don't come out)
  <br>Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now)
  <br>Walk away (walk away), you know how (you know how)
  <br>Don't start caring about me now (so)<br>
  <br>Oh, oh
  <br>Don't come out, out, out
  <br>Don't show up, up, up
  <br>Walk away, walk away (so)<br>
  <br>Oh, oh
  <br>Don't come out, out, out
  <br>Don't show up, up, up
  <br>Walk away, walk away, oh
