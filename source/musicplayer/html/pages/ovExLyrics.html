    <div id="ovEx-lyrics">
      If you don't wanna see me<br>
      <br>Did a full 180, crazy
      <br>Thinking 'bout the way I was
      <br>Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
      <br>But look at where I ended up
      <br>I'm all good already
      <br>So moved on, it's scary
      <br>I'm not where you left me at all, so<br>
      <br>If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
      <br>If you wanna believe that anything could stop me<br>
      <br>Don't show up, don't come out
      <br>Don't start caring about me now
      <br>Walk away, you know how
      <br>Don't start caring about me now<br>
      <br>Aren't you the guy who tried to
      <br>Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
      <br>Though it took some time to survive you
      <br>I'm better on the other side
      <br>I'm all good already
      <br>So moved on, it's scary
      <br>I'm not where you left me at all, so<br>
      <br>If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
      <br>If you wanna believe that anything could stop me<br>
      <br>Don't show up, don't come out
      <br>Don't start caring about me now
      <br>Walk away, you know how
      <br>Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now, 'bout me)<br>
      <br>Oh, oh
      <br>Don't come out, out, out
      <br>Don't show up, up, up
      <br>Don't start now (oh)<br>
      <br>Oh, oh
      <br>Don't come out, out
      <br>I'm not where you left me at all, so<br>
      <br>If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
      <br>If you wanna believe that anything could stop me<br>
      <br>Don't show up (don't show up), don't come out (don't come out)
      <br>Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now)
      <br>Walk away (walk away), you know how (you know how)
      <br>Don't start caring about me now (so)<br>
      <br>Oh, oh
      <br>Don't come out, out, out
      <br>Don't show up, up, up
      <br>Walk away, walk away (so)<br>
      <br>Oh, oh
      <br>Don't come out, out, out
      <br>Don't show up, up, up
      <br>Walk away, walk away, oh
