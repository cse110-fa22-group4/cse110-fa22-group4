| Implementation Priorities | Determine which .html files need to be implemented earlier so that backend can work on core functionality |
| Mob programming           | Write a basic version of watch folders so backend figure out the logic to retreiving files                |


## Decisions:
| Item           | By Who? | Notes                                                                                                                               |
|----------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Styling        | team    | 4 spaces (tab) instead of 2, otherwise follow Google style guidelines (modified eslint)                                             |
| Styling        | team    | Use jsDocs for documentation style                                                                                                  |
| File structure | team    | Having separate .js file for each .html file under /renderer does not seem to work, all .js files need to be linked in index.html   |
| File structure | team    | It seems that it is not possible to link corresponding .js file directly in each .html using `<script>` and have functionality work |
| Frontend       | team    | Decide to prioritize Settings > Watch folder then Playback                                                                          |
| Frontend       | team    | Use same google material icons                                                                                                      |
