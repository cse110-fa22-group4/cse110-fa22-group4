## Agenda:
| Item | Description |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| 2nd Sprint Agile review | see google Docs for more details |
| 2nd Sprint Retrospective meeting | see Miro board for more details |
| Playlist Object | Frontend and Backend needs to decide the object representing the playlist. getPlaylist() currently returns a map but comments say that there should be a json object and still talks about the object being a list of paths. |
| Global searching | It seems that Noah maybe wanted global searching |
| Frontend Debugging Session | Issue with rescanning |
| Testing Debugging Session | Issue with running tests without having to relaunch electron everytime |
| Frontend | Frontend has to decide the data structure of the Queue and how playback should be triggered on click of each grid js element |
| Misc | Short questions were asked on management of github Project and tray icons for app|


## Decisions:
| Item | By Who? | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ---------------- |
| 2nd Sprint Agile review | Group | see google Docs for more details |
| 2nd Sprint Retrospective meeting | Group | see Miro board for more details |
| Playlist Object | Frontend, Backend, Testing | Frontend and Backend decides on returning Map with the structure: <pre>'playlist', { name: 'Summer Mix' numTracks: 32, artworks: ['..img.png', '..img2.png'], trackList: [{track1},{track2},...] }) </pre> for representing playlist in frontend usage. All existing keys in libraryCatalog example is kept except for `playlists`. |
| Global searching | Frontend, Backend | It seems that GridJS already searching from anywhere in the app since its docked to top bar so global searching is redundant |
| Frontend Debugging Session | Noah, Liam | Some functions used in rescanning were removed |
| Testing Debugging Session | Jeremy, Liam | No current solution |
| Frontend | Andrew, Alvin | Will discuss more in-depth next UI meeting (Tue. 11/26). Temperarily data structure of the Queue is just array holding individual songs and playlists. Playback could be triggered on click by getting grid js element's path in index 11 |
| Misc | Frontend, Chi | 'No Status' updated recently in Github Project, the other categories could use an update. Tray icons for app rquested by Chi but this should be easily add-able |
