# Information

## State of the Project

- Sourabh is pretty disappointed with our progress
  - Apparently he didn't know our stuff is hard-coded
  - Some members need to pull their slack
  - Team leads need better communication (and probably the whole team)

## Moving Forward

- We need a lot of extra meetings this week to finish the project
  - If we don't finish the CRUD aspect of our app, our grades will be heavily affected
  - Sourabh is expecting an update by Friday, and really wants to see the main functions of our app working
- We need to connect our frontend and backend

## Grading

- The main component of the app that needs to be done is the CRUD aspect, everything else is just icing
- On Tuesday of finals week we need to have our interviews with Sourabh during the same chunk of time
  - These interviews are individual
  - Up to team leads to find what time works best for everyone
- During our final's week block time, we will be watching videos of everyone's project
