## Notes:
* Soldified Figma as ui designing tool
  * Combine all frames into single group figma project
  * Used prototyping feature to simulate responsive app (where clicks will go)
* Standardize universal ui elements (ex: sliders should all look a certain way regardless of which page user is on, rounded corners everywhere, etc.)
* Decide on colors apart from brand color (Matrix Green and black does not actually work really well aesthically)
* Will likely need to write some JS to parse user input
* Decide to use Vanilla html, Css, JS since professor seems against React framework
* Added additional theoretical stats frame 
* Re-design frames with more modern look
* Pushed discussion of creating elements to work with backend to next meeting
