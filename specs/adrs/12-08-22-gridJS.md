# Use GridJS for data table generation

## Context and Problem Statement

Needed a way to dynamically generate track information contained in the user library and custom user playlists in a table format. Needed to also have flexible search integration as the items/rows generated could number well into the thousands, while also allowing for column sorting.

## Considered Alternative Options

- Vanilla Javascript using a web component template
- jsGrid
- GridJS
  
## Decision Outcome

GridJS:
- Implemented using the javascript supported GridJS table library. GridJS provides highly customizable table generation, allowing us to create functions that could dynamically feed relevant table data into a GridJS table. Whether it was data specific to an entire users song library, or various custom user playlists, a resulting GridJS could be generated that had the ability to parse search queries, allow sortable columns, and include custom buttons for extended functionality depending on the table type. Among other available javascript supported table data libraries, we found GridJS to be the most lightweight and compatible for our use case.

### Consequences

- Good, table has built in search functionality
- Good, table column headers and categories were easily customizable
- Good, table columns can be sorted alphanumerically
- Good, clean and easy to read interface
- Bad, sending relevant data from a given row (currently selected, add to queue) to other parts of the app was tricky
- Bad, could not integrated some basic table functions such as column resizing and select all, they simply did not work 

## Pros and Cons of the Options

- Vanilla Javascript
  - Pros: Data and custom buttons easy to integrate, can be easily styled
  - Cons: Very complicated to integrate deep search function, column sorting
- jsGrid
  - Pros: Capable of sorting by column, searchable, data easy to integrate
  - Cons: Not simple to add custom buttons, Complicated to send data to other parts of app for more functionality, very old library that posed risk of incompatability issues

## Circumstances

Ultimately implemented to help generate library table data, decided in team meeting between backend and frontend.
