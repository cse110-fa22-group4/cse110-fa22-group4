NOTE: all of this is subject to change as we have to learn the technologies and coordinate with each other on ETAs, perhaps the must haves are actually easier or harder than expected, and we don't even know if we're going to implement any desired solutions or stretch goals
Week 5-half of week 7(There are a lot of features, which is why we likely have to consume part of week 7):
Get Must-haves out of the way:
- Skip missing songs
- Play from local file
- Uses supported JS audio types
- User-focused UI(easy to use even for the most tech-illiterate people)
- Metadata search and editor
- Playlist creation

Half of week 7 - week 8:
Tackle Desired solutions:
- local binaries to support more audio types
- user stats

Week 9-10:
Optimize and tackle stretch goals:
- Export/import playlists
- Themes
- Fuzzy hashing
- Lyrics through subtitles
